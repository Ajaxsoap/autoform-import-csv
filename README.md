# autoform-import-csv
<p>This is an attempt to see the validation of tres combos, aldeed(autoform,SimpleSchema,tabular) by importing a csv file from the client and parse it to a table(tabular). </p>
<p>The import is successful and it displays all the data on the table, however, if you look into the console(terminal), it has validation errors. hhmmm. What is happening down there?</p>
